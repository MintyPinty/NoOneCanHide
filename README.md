# NoOneCanHide
Uses Valorant &amp; Henrikdev API to bypass streamer mode.

## Installation & Setup
1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Make sure to add Python to path.)
2. Open install.bat and wait until it downloads all the modules.
3. Join the [Henrikdev Discord Server](https://discord.gg/henrikdev-systems-704231681309278228) and apply for an api key.
4. Edit config.json with a text editor and enter the api key you applied for.
5. Open start.bat and queue up for a game.

## Can I get banned?
Maybe. Programs like this is against Riot TOS and MIGHT get you banned for API ABUSE. However, I have personally used this for OVER a year for 1000+ matches and have not gotten banned.
