# NoOneCanHide
Uses Valorant &amp; Henrikdev API to bypass streamer mode.

## Installation & Setup
1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Make sure to add Python to path.)
2. Open install.bat and wait until it downloads all the modules.
3. Join the [Henrikdev Discord Server](https://discord.gg/henrikdev-systems-704231681309278228) and apply for an api key.
4. Edit config.json with a text editor and enter the api key you applied for.
6. Launch valorant before opening start.bat.

## Regions
Enter the correct region id inside of config.json.
 - na ( Brazil and Latam included )
 - eu ( Europe )
 - ap ( Asia Pacific )
 - kr ( South Korea )

## Can I get banned?
Maybe. Programs like this is against Riot TOS and MIGHT get you banned for API ABUSE. However, I have personally used this for OVER a year for 1000+ matches and have not gotten banned.
